#library(StructureFunction)

## The following libraries are automatically loaded with the StructureFunction package (above)
library(tidyverse)
library(zeallot)


## This library is optional; only needed to combine plots together
library(ggpubr)

### CSV files for an example are provided in the StructureFunction/data folder ###
